    <h2>Front End Development</h2>
    <p>A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer</p>
    <ol type="A">
        
        <li>html</li>
        <li>css</li>
        <li>javascript</li>
        <li>react</li>
        <li>angular</li>
        <li>Vue

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Descriptions of the above is is seen below</p>
<dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages. 
        It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.
            To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:
            <dl>
                <dl>Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items</dl>
                <dl>Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format</dl>
                <dl>Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.</dl>
            </dl>
    </dd>
</dt>
<dt>css</dt>
    <dd>CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”.

        CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML).
        
        This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files (.css)
    </dd>
    

    <dt>JavaScript</dt>
    <dd> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area
    </dd>
    To recap on each of them, we will give a short description below for reminder:
            <dl>
                <dl>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</dl>
                <dl>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</dl>
                <dl>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</dl>
            </dl>
    </dd>
   
    <dt>React</dt>
    <dd> React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality
    </dd>
    React in itself has a very small API, and you basically need to understand 4 concepts to get started:
            <dl>
                <li>components</li>
                <li>JSX</li>
                <li>State</li>
                <li>Props</li>
                
            </dl>
    </dd>

  
</li>

    <dl>Html 1</dl>
    <dl>Html 2</dl>
    <dl>Html 3</dl>
</dd>
    <h2>Back End Development</h2>
    <p>Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.
        Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.
